            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
              As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly integrated into business operations, organizations face 
              a new paradigm of cybersecurity challenges. While AI offers powerful defensive capabilities, it also 
              introduces novel attack vectors and security considerations that require comprehensive strategic responses.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8 text-aiwia-black border-b-2 border-aiwia-blue pb-2">AI-Specific Security Challenges</h2>
            
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6 text-aiwia-blue">Model Poisoning and Data Integrity</h3>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
              Attackers can compromise AI systems by manipulating training data or model parameters. Data poisoning 
              attacks can subtly alter AI behavior, leading to incorrect decisions or biased outcomes that may not 
              be immediately apparent to users or administrators.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6 text-aiwia-blue">Adversarial Attacks</h3>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
              AI systems are vulnerable to adversarial inputs designed to fool machine learning models. These carefully 
              crafted inputs can cause AI systems to make incorrect classifications or decisions, potentially leading 
              to security breaches or operational failures.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6 text-aiwia-blue">Model Extraction and Intellectual Property Theft</h3>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
              Sophisticated attackers may attempt to reverse-engineer proprietary AI models through repeated queries 
              and analysis. This form of intellectual property theft can compromise competitive advantages and expose 
              sensitive algorithmic approaches.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8 text-aiwia-black border-b-2 border-aiwia-blue pb-2">Enhanced Threat Landscape</h2>
            
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6 text-aiwia-blue">AI-Powered Cyberattacks</h3>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
              Cybercriminals are leveraging AI to create more sophisticated and targeted attacks. AI-generated phishing 
              emails, deepfake social engineering, and automated vulnerability discovery are becoming increasingly common 
              and effective attack methods.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6 text-aiwia-blue">Scale and Speed of Attacks</h3>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
              AI enables attackers to operate at unprecedented scale and speed. Automated reconnaissance, rapid exploit 
              development, and mass-scale social engineering campaigns can overwhelm traditional security defenses 
              that rely on human intervention.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8 text-aiwia-black border-b-2 border-aiwia-blue pb-2">AI-Enhanced Defense Strategies</h2>
            
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6 text-aiwia-blue">Behavioral Analytics and Anomaly Detection</h3>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
              AI-powered security solutions can analyze vast amounts of network traffic, user behavior, and system 
              logs to identify subtle patterns that indicate potential threats. These systems can detect zero-day 
              attacks and insider threats that traditional signature-based solutions might miss.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6 text-aiwia-blue">Automated Incident Response</h3>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
              Machine learning algorithms can automate threat containment and response processes, reducing the time 
              between threat detection and mitigation. This rapid response capability is crucial for limiting the 
              impact of sophisticated cyberattacks.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6 text-aiwia-blue">Predictive Threat Intelligence</h3>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
              AI systems can analyze global threat intelligence feeds, dark web communications, and attack patterns 
              to predict emerging threats and vulnerabilities. This proactive approach enables organizations to 
              strengthen defenses before attacks occur.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8 text-aiwia-black border-b-2 border-aiwia-blue pb-2">Secure AI Development Practices</h2>
            
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6 text-aiwia-blue">AI Security by Design</h3>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
              Organizations must integrate security considerations throughout the AI development lifecycle. This includes 
              secure coding practices, robust testing methodologies, and comprehensive security reviews at each 
              development stage.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6 text-aiwia-blue">Data Security and Privacy</h3>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
              AI systems require extensive data access, creating new privacy and security challenges. Organizations 
              must implement strong data governance, encryption, and access controls to protect sensitive information 
              used in AI training and operations.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8 text-aiwia-black border-b-2 border-aiwia-blue pb-2">Regulatory and Compliance Considerations</h2>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
              The intersection of AI and cybersecurity is attracting increased regulatory attention. Organizations must 
              navigate evolving compliance requirements while ensuring their AI systems meet security standards and 
              data protection regulations.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8 text-aiwia-black border-b-2 border-aiwia-blue pb-2">Building Cyber-Resilient AI Systems</h2>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
              Successful cybersecurity in the AI age requires a holistic approach that combines technical controls, 
              process improvements, and organizational culture changes. Organizations must invest in AI-specific 
              security expertise, continuous monitoring capabilities, and adaptive defense strategies that evolve 
              with the threat landscape.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
              As AI continues to transform business operations, cybersecurity must evolve from a reactive discipline 
              to a proactive, AI-enhanced capability that can protect organizations while enabling innovation and 
              digital transformation.
