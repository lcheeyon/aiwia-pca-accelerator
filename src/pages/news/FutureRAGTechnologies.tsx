            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
              Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technologies are transforming the customer service landscape by 
              combining the power of large language models with real-time information retrieval. This revolutionary 
              approach enables more accurate, contextual, and up-to-date customer support interactions.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8 text-aiwia-black border-b-2 border-aiwia-blue pb-2">What is RAG Technology?</h2>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
              RAG represents a hybrid approach that enhances traditional language models by incorporating external 
              knowledge sources. Instead of relying solely on pre-trained knowledge, RAG systems can retrieve relevant 
              information from databases, documents, and knowledge bases to provide more accurate and current responses.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8 text-aiwia-black border-b-2 border-aiwia-blue pb-2">RAG in Customer Service Applications</h2>
            
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6 text-aiwia-blue">Enhanced Knowledge Base Integration</h3>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
              RAG technology seamlessly integrates with existing knowledge bases, FAQs, and documentation systems. 
              Customer service agents and chatbots can access the most current information, product specifications, 
              and troubleshooting guides to provide accurate assistance.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6 text-aiwia-blue">Contextual Response Generation</h3>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
              Unlike traditional chatbots that rely on predefined responses, RAG-powered systems generate contextually 
              appropriate answers based on retrieved information. This results in more natural, helpful, and accurate 
              customer interactions.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6 text-aiwia-blue">Multi-Source Information Synthesis</h3>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
              RAG systems can retrieve information from multiple sources simultaneously, synthesizing complex answers 
              from various knowledge repositories. This capability is particularly valuable for addressing sophisticated 
              customer inquiries that require information from multiple departments or systems.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8 text-aiwia-black border-b-2 border-aiwia-blue pb-2">Benefits for Organizations</h2>
            
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6 text-aiwia-blue">Improved Response Accuracy</h3>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
              By accessing real-time information, RAG systems significantly reduce the likelihood of providing outdated 
              or incorrect information to customers. This improved accuracy leads to higher customer satisfaction and 
              reduced escalations.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6 text-aiwia-blue">Faster Query Resolution</h3>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
              RAG technology enables instant access to vast knowledge repositories, allowing customer service representatives 
              to quickly find relevant information without manually searching through multiple systems or documents.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6 text-aiwia-blue">Scalable Support Operations</h3>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
              Organizations can handle increased customer inquiry volumes without proportionally increasing staff, 
              as RAG-powered systems can autonomously handle routine questions while escalating complex issues to human agents.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8 text-aiwia-black border-b-2 border-aiwia-blue pb-2">Implementation Considerations</h2>
            
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6 text-aiwia-blue">Data Quality and Organization</h3>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
              Successful RAG implementation requires well-organized, accurate, and up-to-date knowledge repositories. 
              Organizations must invest in content management and data quality processes to maximize RAG effectiveness.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6 text-aiwia-blue">Integration Complexity</h3>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
              Integrating RAG systems with existing customer service platforms, CRM systems, and knowledge bases 
              requires careful planning and technical expertise. Organizations should consider gradual implementation 
              approaches to minimize disruption.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8 text-aiwia-black border-b-2 border-aiwia-blue pb-2">Future Developments</h2>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
              The future of RAG in customer service includes advances in multi-modal capabilities (incorporating 
              images, videos, and documents), improved reasoning capabilities, and better integration with business 
              processes. These developments will further enhance the customer service experience while reducing 
              operational costs.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
              As RAG technology continues to mature, organizations that adopt these solutions early will gain 
              significant competitive advantages in customer service quality, operational efficiency, and customer 
              satisfaction metrics.
