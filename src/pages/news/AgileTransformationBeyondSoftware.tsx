              While agile methodologies originated in software development, forward-thinking organizations are now 
              applying agile principles across all business functions, from marketing and finance to human resources 
              and operations. This enterprise-wide agile transformation is driving unprecedented levels of adaptability 
              and performance.

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8 text-aiwia-black border-b-2 border-aiwia-blue pb-2">Agile Beyond IT: The Business Case</h2>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
              Traditional business functions often operate in silos with lengthy planning cycles and rigid processes. 
              In today's rapidly changing business environment, these approaches can hinder responsiveness and innovation. 
              Agile methodologies offer a framework for increased collaboration, faster decision-making, and continuous improvement.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8 text-aiwia-black border-b-2 border-aiwia-blue pb-2">Agile in Different Business Functions</h2>
            
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6 text-aiwia-blue">Marketing and Sales</h3>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
              Agile marketing teams work in short sprints to develop and test campaigns, enabling rapid response to 
              market changes and customer feedback. Sales teams use agile approaches to manage pipeline development, 
              customer engagement, and territory planning with increased flexibility and visibility.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6 text-aiwia-blue">Human Resources</h3>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
              HR departments are adopting agile practices for recruitment, performance management, and organizational 
              development. Agile HR focuses on continuous feedback, iterative improvement, and employee-centric approaches 
              that enhance engagement and productivity.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6 text-aiwia-blue">Finance and Operations</h3>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
              Financial planning and operations teams use agile methodologies for budgeting, forecasting, and process 
              improvement. This approach enables more responsive financial management and operational optimization 
              based on real-time data and changing business conditions.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8 text-aiwia-black border-b-2 border-aiwia-blue pb-2">Key Principles of Business Agility</h2>
            
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6 text-aiwia-blue">Customer-Centricity</h3>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
              Agile transformation puts customers at the center of all business activities. Teams focus on delivering 
              value to customers through iterative improvements and continuous feedback loops that ensure solutions 
              meet evolving needs.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6 text-aiwia-blue">Collaborative Cross-Functional Teams</h3>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
              Breaking down silos and creating cross-functional teams enables faster decision-making and more innovative 
              solutions. Team members from different departments work together toward common goals with shared accountability.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6 text-aiwia-blue">Continuous Learning and Adaptation</h3>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
              Agile organizations embrace experimentation and learning from failures. Regular retrospectives and 
              continuous improvement processes help teams adapt quickly to changing circumstances and optimize performance.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8 text-aiwia-black border-b-2 border-aiwia-blue pb-2">Implementation Strategies</h2>
            
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6 text-aiwia-blue">Start Small and Scale</h3>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
              Successful agile transformation typically begins with pilot projects in receptive areas of the organization. 
              Early wins build momentum and demonstrate value, enabling gradual expansion to other business functions.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6 text-aiwia-blue">Leadership Commitment</h3>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
              Agile transformation requires strong leadership support and cultural change. Leaders must model agile 
              behaviors, remove organizational impediments, and create an environment that supports experimentation 
              and continuous improvement.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6 text-aiwia-blue">Training and Coaching</h3>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
              Organizations invest in comprehensive training programs and coaching to help employees develop agile 
              mindsets and skills. This includes both formal training and hands-on mentoring from experienced agile practitioners.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8 text-aiwia-black border-b-2 border-aiwia-blue pb-2">Measuring Success</h2>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
              Agile transformation success is measured through various metrics including time-to-market improvements, 
              customer satisfaction scores, employee engagement levels, and business outcome achievements. Organizations 
              also track process metrics such as cycle times and collaboration effectiveness.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8 text-aiwia-black border-b-2 border-aiwia-blue pb-2">Challenges and Solutions</h2>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
              Common challenges include resistance to change, existing organizational structures, and measurement systems 
              designed for traditional approaches. Successful organizations address these challenges through clear 
              communication, gradual implementation, and alignment of incentives with agile values.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
              As business environments become increasingly volatile and competitive, agile transformation beyond software 
              development represents a critical capability for organizational survival and success. Companies that embrace 
              business agility position themselves to thrive in uncertain times while delivering superior value to customers.
