              Singapore's Data Protection Trustmark (DPTM) represents a significant advancement in privacy compliance, 
              offering organizations a structured pathway to demonstrate their commitment to data protection while 
              building stronger customer relationships through enhanced trust.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8 text-aiwia-black border-b-2 border-aiwia-blue pb-2">Understanding the Data Protection Trustmark</h2>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
              The DPTM is a voluntary certification scheme administered by the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) 
              of Singapore. It recognizes organizations that have implemented robust data protection practices that go 
              beyond basic compliance with the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA).
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8 text-aiwia-black border-b-2 border-aiwia-blue pb-2">Certification Levels</h2>
            
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6 text-aiwia-blue">Basic Level</h3>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
              The basic level certification focuses on fundamental data protection practices including policy development, 
              staff training, and basic security measures. Organizations demonstrate compliance with core PDPA requirements 
              and implementation of essential privacy safeguards.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6 text-aiwia-blue">Intermediate Level</h3>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
              Intermediate certification requires more comprehensive data protection frameworks including advanced security 
              controls, regular audits, and enhanced transparency measures. Organizations must show evidence of continuous 
              improvement in their privacy practices.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6 text-aiwia-blue">Advanced Level</h3>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
              The advanced level represents best-in-class data protection practices with sophisticated risk management, 
              privacy-by-design implementation, and proactive privacy governance. This level demonstrates industry 
              leadership in data protection.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8 text-aiwia-black border-b-2 border-aiwia-blue pb-2">Business Value Proposition</h2>
            
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6 text-aiwia-blue">Enhanced Customer Trust</h3>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
              DPTM certification provides customers with visible assurance that their personal data is handled responsibly. 
              This trust translates into improved customer relationships, higher retention rates, and increased willingness 
              to share information for service enhancement.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6 text-aiwia-blue">Competitive Advantage</h3>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
              In an increasingly privacy-conscious market, DPTM certification differentiates organizations from competitors. 
              Certified organizations can leverage their trustmark status in marketing, procurement processes, and 
              partnership negotiations.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6 text-aiwia-blue">Risk Mitigation</h3>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
              The structured approach to data protection required for DPTM certification helps organizations identify 
              and address privacy risks before they become compliance issues or data breaches. This proactive approach 
              reduces potential financial and reputational damages.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8 text-aiwia-black border-b-2 border-aiwia-blue pb-2">Implementation Process</h2>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
              Achieving DPTM certification requires a systematic approach including gap analysis, policy development, 
              staff training, and implementation of technical and organizational measures. Organizations must also 
              establish ongoing monitoring and continuous improvement processes.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8 text-aiwia-black border-b-2 border-aiwia-blue pb-2">Industry Impact</h2>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
              Organizations across various sectors including finance, healthcare, retail, and technology have successfully 
              obtained DPTM certification. These organizations report improved stakeholder confidence, enhanced 
              operational efficiency, and better preparedness for evolving privacy regulations.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
              As data protection continues to gain prominence globally, Singapore's DPTM serves as a model for other 
              jurisdictions considering similar certification schemes. The trustmark demonstrates how voluntary 
              certification can complement regulatory compliance to create a more robust privacy ecosystem.
